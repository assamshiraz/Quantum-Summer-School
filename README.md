The IBM Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 was hosted in July 2024 and made for its students to apply the Qiskit Patterns Framework. This way, students would be able to solve problems effectively with building circuits, transpiling and optimizing circuits, and then translating the circuit to the real quantum hardware. 

Leading to applications in infrastructure engineering and quantum software engineering. 

The skills I needed to complete Lab 1, Lab 2 and Lab 4 was python programming skills involving Qiskit, documentation reading/self-learning, simulating circuits, simulating physical objects like the Heinsenberg spin chain, OOP, modularity, and data analysis (heavily in lab 4).

This showcases my ability to adapt to unfamiliar work environments, be willing to learn, (even when it gets hard) and software programming as a whole.
